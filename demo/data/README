Motion capture data from the band perfume (http://www.perfume-global.com/)

I do not own the rights to this data, and am redistributing it as part of
my 'project' - as per the vaguely worded agreement on the Perfume Global website.

In order to use the data yourself, you must download it from their site and
agree to the terms.
